# What is A Restful API
A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.

# API, Definition
An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. It’s sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an information user—establishing the content required from the consumer (the call) and the content required by the producer (the response). For example, the API design for a weather service could specify that the user supply a zip code and that the producer reply with a 2-part answer, the first being the high temperature, and the second being the low.  

# Project Idea
I have taught how to create api in php to fetch data from database in php pdo, REST API in PHP and PHP API CRUD. You can interact with the database with the use of the CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) via the API. This project is created from cratch.
